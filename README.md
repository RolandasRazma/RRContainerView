**iOS6** "Container View" backport to **iOS5**

Disclaimer
============
Use at your own risk. This is App Store valid. iPad version of [@YPlan](http://yplanapp.com) uses it for **iOS5** support :)


What you will find inside
============
If you fork, you will find workspace with 2 projects **RRTestApp** and **RRContainerView**.<br />
**RRTestApp** has "Container View" created in interface builder (like you normally would do for iOS6), whats interesting is that it has deployment target iOS5. You can run same project on iOS6 and iOS5 and it should look and behave the same. Essentially its iOS6 "Container View" back port to iOS5

I don't have blog so...
============
So I started build iPad version of [@YPlan](http://yplanapp.com) and thought it would be nice to use iOS6 "Container View" in Interface Builder - unfortunately its iOS6 onlyâ€¦ As I had a lot of fun porting [AutoLayout](https://github.com/RolandasRazma/RRAutoLayout) to iOS5 I decided to do same for "Container View". This should be App Store valid but I will update about that after iPad version of [@YPlan](http://yplanapp.com) will be approved/rejected :)

Will it slow down my iOS6+ app?
============
It will have no effect on your app. On iOS versions where "Container View" supported by default, the default implementation is used.

How to use it in my project?
============
Just drop `RRStoryboardEmbedSegue.h` and `RRStoryboardEmbedSegue.m` into your project and forget about them :)

This is wicked, do you have more?
